{"name":"Vala","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/vala","body":"Vala is a programming language that aims to bring modern programming\r\nlanguage features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional\r\nruntime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to\r\napplications and libraries written in C.\r\n\r\nvalac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates\r\nVala source code into C source and header files. It uses the GObject\r\ntype system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala source\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of Vala is similar to C#, modified to better fit the GObject\r\ntype system. Vala supports modern language features as the following:\r\n\r\n\t* Interfaces\r\n\t* Properties\r\n\t* Signals\r\n\t* Foreach\r\n\t* Lambda expressions\r\n\t* Type inference for local variables\r\n\t* Generics\r\n\t* Non-null types\r\n\t* Assisted memory management\r\n\t* Exception handling\r\n\r\nVala is designed to allow access to existing C libraries, especially\r\nGObject-based libraries, without the need for runtime bindings. All that\r\nis needed to use a library with Vala is an API file, containing the class\r\nand method declarations in Vala syntax. Vala currently comes with\r\nbindings for GLib and GTK+. It's planned to provide generated bindings for\r\nthe full GNOME Platform at a later stage.\r\n\r\nUsing classes and methods written in Vala from an application written in\r\nC is not difficult. The Vala library only has to install the generated\r\nheader files and C applications may then access the GObject-based API of\r\nthe Vala library as usual. It should also be easily possible to write a\r\nbindings generator for access to Vala libraries from applications\r\nwritten in e.g. C# as the Vala parser is written as a library, so that\r\nall compile-time information is available when generating a binding.\r\n\r\nMore information about Vala is available at\r\n\r\n\thttp://live.gnome.org/Vala/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
